### Hardware Specification

This project operates using a **two-PC, machine-to-machine connection** setup to divide the computational load between high-fidelity rendering and real-time intelligence.

### 1. Rendering PC (Unreal Engine)

This machine is dedicated to running **Unreal Engine** for high-quality, real-time cinematic visuals.

| Component | Specification (Equivalent or Better) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Windows 11 Home Edition | Standard OS for high-end rendering applications. |
| **GPU** | **NVIDIA RTX 4090** | Essential for complex real-time ray tracing and high-resolution rendering. |
| **VRAM** | **24 GB or Higher** | Critical requirement for loading large-scale textures, assets, and complex scenes. |
| **CPU** | **Intel Ultra 9** | High-performance processor to manage game logic, physics, and scene preparation. |
| **RAM** | 32 GB | Sufficient memory for simultaneous operation of Unreal Engine and the OS. |
| **Storage** | 1 TB SSD | Fast loading times for project assets and quick iteration. |

### 2. Local LLM PC (Intelligent Core): Advantech AIR-030

This machine is dedicated to hosting the **Edge-LLM** (Local Large Language Model) for localized, fast, and smart interaction processing.
